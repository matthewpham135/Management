subject: 70% increase in contact rates

Hi Anna,

What would it mean to your top-line revenue if
you saw a 70% increase in contact rates, 50% improvement in closes, and 40% increase in
quota-hitting sales reps?

Let's find a few minutes to talk about how DailyStory.com is providing these results to our
clients.

I'm available tomorrow at 10A and again at
2P PT. Can we chat?

Thanks,
Rob
