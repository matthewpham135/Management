    Communism in Bulgaria came to an end in
the early 1990s when the ruling communist
party gave up the monopoly they had over the
political system. As a result, multi-party
elections took place in Bulgaria for the first
time since the late 1930s. Bulgaria ended up
changing the country's official  name to the
Republic of Bulgaria and also removed the
communist state emblem from the national
flag.
